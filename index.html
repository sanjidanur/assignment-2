They are experts within a specific community who endorse or review products, software, or even thoughts within their field of expertise. Others in the community look to them when making their own purchasing choices.

                    Influencers yield a lot of power. If you can get an influencer to endorse your product or brand, you can tap into the audience at the influencers disposal, which may be far more vast than your own following.</p>

                    <p class="product-details">Drones are able to extend the reach of security services quickly, remotely, and at little cost. The drones can take pictures and send them back to base, order someone to take a particular action, or perform other services for security. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prohibits the use of an unmanned flying vehicle for commercial purposes. Exemptions are available when drones travel over ones own property for security purposes if no risks to aviation are posed.

                        Nonetheless, FAA regulations will be made public in 2016 that may provide exemptions more broadly. Quadcopters can shoot images of a distant alarm condition and can even provide two-way communication with persons at the site of the alarm. Currently, amateurs and hobbyists are driving interest in drones. Amateur drone pilots may not fly them higher than 400 ft off the ground and not lose sight of the vehicle.</p>

                    <p class="product-details">If you want a very good picture of a lightning bolt, a DSLR or mirrorless camera with a tripod is almost a must. If you have a point and shoot, make sure that your camera allows you to set manual controls for shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. Also be sure that it has an option for RAW files rather than just JPEG (see RAW vs JPEG).

                        Another critical piece of equipment is a tripod. Some people get lucky by taking a good picture of lightning hand-held, but I strongly advise you to use a tripod instead. You will need to use a long shutter speed to capture good lightning photos </p>

                    <p class="product-details">A microphone is a device that translates sound vibrations in the air into electronic signals or scribes them to a recording medium. Microphones enable many types of audio recording devices for purposes including communications of many kinds, as well as music and speech recording.

                        Frequently, microphones are designed for a given purpose. One of the main considerations, aside from the type of device, is what is being recorded. Directionality of microphones is one such consideration in microphone design. Omnidirectional  microphones are suited to recording all sounds in an area but poor for focusing on a single subject amongst background noise. Directional, bidirectional and shotgun microphones are suitable for interviews. However, the same effect is often achieved with two unidirectional devices, such as cardioid microphones.</p>
